Taiwan_Bot_Tournament_2048
==========================

These codes are used in Taiwan Bot Tournament for game 2048.

We don't have much time to refactor the code and make it look nice...

and in these files, there are no TD learning codes included.

To run the programs using our data trained by TD can be downloaded at http://aigames.nctu.edu.tw/~cgilab/download/
